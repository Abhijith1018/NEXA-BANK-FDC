# Non-Cumulative FD with Compounding - Fix Documentation

## Issue Fixed

### Problem
For non-cumulative FDs with **different compounding and payout frequencies**, the interest calculation was incorrect. The system was using simple interest instead of compound interest.

**Example:**
- **Compounding Frequency:** QUARTERLY (4 times/year)
- **Payout Frequency:** YEARLY (1 time/year)

**Previous (Incorrect) Calculation:**
```
Annual Interest = Principal × Rate
Payout = Annual Interest / 1
= 50,000 × 0.1025
= ₹5,125
```

**Correct Calculation:**
```
Quarterly Rate = 10.25% / 4 = 2.5625%
Compound Factor = (1 + 0.025625)^4 = 1.106507584
Yearly Payout = 50,000 × (1.106507584 - 1)
= 50,000 × 0.106507584
= ₹5,325.38
```

## Solution Implemented

### New Method: `calculatePeriodicPayoutWithCompounding()`

This method properly handles compound interest for non-cumulative FDs.

**Formula:**
```
Payout Amount = Principal × [(1 + r/m)^n - 1]

Where:
- r = Annual rate (as decimal)
- m = Compounding periods per year
- n = Number of compounding periods per payout period
```

**Parameters:**
- `principal` - Principal amount
- `ratePct` - Effective annual rate (%)
- `payoutFreq` - How often interest is paid out
- `compoundingFreq` - How often interest compounds

## Examples

### Example 1: Quarterly Compounding, Yearly Payout

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 50000,
  "tenure_value": 5,
  "tenure_unit": "YEARS",
  "compounding_frequency": "QUARTERLY",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY",
  "effective_rate": 10.25
}
```

**Calculation:**
```
Principal: ₹50,000
Rate: 10.25%
Compounding: QUARTERLY (4/year)
Payout: YEARLY (1/year)
Compounds per payout: 4/1 = 4

Rate per quarter: 10.25% / 4 = 2.5625%
Compound factor: (1.025625)^4 = 1.106507584

Yearly Payout: 50,000 × (1.106507584 - 1)
             = 50,000 × 0.106507584
             = ₹5,325.38
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "maturity_value": 50000.00,
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY",
  "payout_amount": 5325.3792
}
```

---

### Example 2: Quarterly Compounding, Quarterly Payout

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 100000,
  "tenure_value": 3,
  "tenure_unit": "YEARS",
  "compounding_frequency": "QUARTERLY",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "QUARTERLY",
  "effective_rate": 8.0
}
```

**Calculation:**
```
Principal: ₹100,000
Rate: 8%
Compounding: QUARTERLY (4/year)
Payout: QUARTERLY (4/year)
Compounds per payout: 4/4 = 1

Rate per quarter: 8% / 4 = 2%
Compound factor: (1.02)^1 = 1.02

Quarterly Payout: 100,000 × (1.02 - 1)
                = 100,000 × 0.02
                = ₹2,000
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "maturity_value": 100000.00,
  "payout_freq": "QUARTERLY",
  "payout_amount": 2000.0000
}
```

---

### Example 3: Monthly Compounding, Quarterly Payout

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 100000,
  "tenure_value": 2,
  "tenure_unit": "YEARS",
  "compounding_frequency": "MONTHLY",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "QUARTERLY",
  "effective_rate": 9.0
}
```

**Calculation:**
```
Principal: ₹100,000
Rate: 9%
Compounding: MONTHLY (12/year)
Payout: QUARTERLY (4/year)
Compounds per payout: 12/4 = 3

Rate per month: 9% / 12 = 0.75%
Compound factor: (1.0075)^3 = 1.022669

Quarterly Payout: 100,000 × (1.022669 - 1)
                = 100,000 × 0.022669
                = ₹2,266.90
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "maturity_value": 100000.00,
  "payout_freq": "QUARTERLY",
  "payout_amount": 2266.9000
}
```

---

### Example 4: Quarterly Compounding, Monthly Payout

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 100000,
  "compounding_frequency": "QUARTERLY",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "MONTHLY",
  "effective_rate": 8.0
}
```

**Behavior:**
```
Payout frequency (MONTHLY = 12/year) is MORE frequent than 
compounding frequency (QUARTERLY = 4/year).

In this case, n = 12/4 = 0.something (less than 1)
System falls back to simple interest calculation with warning log.
```

**Warning:**
```
WARN: Payout frequency (MONTHLY) is more frequent than compounding 
frequency (QUARTERLY). Using simple interest calculation.
```

## Calculation Logic Flow

```
1. Get compounding periods per year:
   - DAILY: 365
   - MONTHLY: 12
   - QUARTERLY: 4
   - YEARLY: 1

2. Get payout periods per year:
   - MONTHLY: 12
   - QUARTERLY: 4
   - YEARLY: 1

3. Calculate compounds per payout:
   n = compounding_periods_per_year / payout_periods_per_year

4. If n < 1:
   - Log warning
   - Use simple interest (fallback)
   
5. Calculate compound interest:
   rate_per_period = annual_rate / compounding_periods_per_year
   compound_factor = (1 + rate_per_period)^n
   payout_amount = principal × (compound_factor - 1)
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Scenario: QUARTERLY compounding, YEARLY payout

**Request:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 50000,
  "compounding_frequency": "QUARTERLY",
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY",
  "effective_rate": 10.25
}
```

**Before Fix:**
```json
{
  "payout_amount": 5125.0000  // Wrong! (simple interest)
}
```

**After Fix:**
```json
{
  "payout_amount": 5325.3792  // Correct! (compound interest)
}
```

**Difference:** ₹200.38 per year (₹1,001.90 over 5 years)

---

## Code Changes

### Method Replaced:
- ❌ **Old:** `calculatePeriodicPayout()` - Used simple interest
- ✅ **New:** `calculatePeriodicPayoutWithCompounding()` - Uses compound interest

### New Logic:
```java
// Calculate compound interest for one payout period
double ratePerCompoundingPeriod = rate.doubleValue() / compoundingPeriodsPerYear;
double compoundFactor = Math.pow(1.0 + ratePerCompoundingPeriod, n);
double interestFactor = compoundFactor - 1.0;

BigDecimal payoutAmount = principal.multiply(
    new BigDecimal(interestFactor, MathContext.DECIMAL64)
);
```

## Benefits

### Financial Accuracy:
✅ **Accurate Interest Calculation** - Properly compounds interest before payout  
✅ **Fair to Customers** - Customers get the correct compound interest  
✅ **Matches Market Standards** - Aligns with standard banking practices  

### Flexibility:
