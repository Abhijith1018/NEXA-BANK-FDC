# Non-Cumulative FD - APY Calculation Fix

## Issue Fixed

### Problem
For non-cumulative FDs with compounding, the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) was showing the same as the effective rate, instead of reflecting the actual compounded return.

**Example:**
- Effective Rate: 10.25%
- Compounding: QUARTERLY (4 times/year)
- **Previous APY:** 10.25% (Wrong - just the nominal rate)
- **Correct APY:** 10.6508% (Accounts for quarterly compounding)

---

## Solution

Updated the non-cumulative FD calculation to properly compute APY using the compounding frequency.

### Formula Used:
```
APY = (1 + r/n)^n - 1

Where:
- r = Effective rate (as decimal)
- n = Compounding periods per year
```

### Code Change:
```java
// Before (Wrong):
apy = effectiveRate;  // Just the nominal rate

// After (Correct):
if (req.compounding_frequency() != null && !"SIMPLE".equalsIgnoreCase(req.interest_type())) {
    apy = calcAPY(effectiveRate, req.compounding_frequency());
} else {
    apy = effectiveRate;  // Simple interest or no compounding
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quarterly Compounding, 10.25% Rate

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 50000,
  "effective_rate": 10.25,
  "compounding_frequency": "QUARTERLY",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY"
}
```

**APY Calculation:**
```
Rate: 10.25% = 0.1025
Compounding: QUARTERLY (n = 4)

APY = (1 + 0.1025/4)^4 - 1
    = (1 + 0.025625)^4 - 1
    = (1.025625)^4 - 1
    = 1.106508 - 1
    = 0.106508
    = 10.6508%
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "effective_rate": 10.2500,
  "apy": 10.6508,           ‚úÖ Correct!
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY",
  "payout_amount": 5325.3792
}
```

### Example 2: Monthly Compounding, 9% Rate

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 100000,
  "effective_rate": 9.0,
  "compounding_frequency": "MONTHLY",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "QUARTERLY"
}
```

**APY Calculation:**
```
Rate: 9% = 0.09
Compounding: MONTHLY (n = 12)

APY = (1 + 0.09/12)^12 - 1
    = (1 + 0.0075)^12 - 1
    = (1.0075)^12 - 1
    = 1.093807 - 1
    = 0.093807
    = 9.3807%
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "effective_rate": 9.0000,
  "apy": 9.3807,            ‚úÖ Correct!
  "payout_freq": "QUARTERLY",
  "payout_amount": 2266.9000
}
```

### Example 3: Daily Compounding, 8% Rate

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 100000,
  "effective_rate": 8.0,
  "compounding_frequency": "DAILY",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "MONTHLY"
}
```

**APY Calculation:**
```
Rate: 8% = 0.08
Compounding: DAILY (n = 365)

APY = (1 + 0.08/365)^365 - 1
    = (1 + 0.000219178)^365 - 1
    = 1.083278 - 1
    = 0.083278
    = 8.3278%
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "effective_rate": 8.0000,
  "apy": 8.3278,            ‚úÖ Correct!
  "payout_freq": "MONTHLY",
  "payout_amount": 668.7000
}
```

### Example 4: Simple Interest (No Compounding)

**Input:**
```json
{
  "principal_amount": 100000,
  "effective_rate": 7.0,
  "interest_type": "SIMPLE",
  "cumulative": false,
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY"
}
```

**APY Calculation:**
```
Simple interest - no compounding
APY = Effective Rate
APY = 7.0%
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "effective_rate": 7.0000,
  "apy": 7.0000,            ‚úÖ Same as effective rate for simple interest
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY",
  "payout_amount": 7000.0000
}
```

## Why APY Matters

### For Customers:
‚úÖ **True Return Rate** - Shows actual annual return after compounding  
‚úÖ **Accurate Comparison** - Can compare different FDs fairly  
‚úÖ **Better Understanding** - Understands real earning potential  

### For Bank:
‚úÖ **Regulatory Compliance** - APY disclosure often required  
‚úÖ **Transparency** - Accurate product information  
‚úÖ **Customer Trust** - Honest representation of returns

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Your Original Example

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/fd-calculator/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "principal_amount": 50000,
    "tenure_value": 5,
    "tenure_unit": "YEARS",
    "interest_type": "COMPOUND",
    "compounding_frequency": "QUARTERLY",
    "currency_code": "INR",
    "category1_id": "SENIOR",
    "category2_id": "GOLD",
    "cumulative": false,
    "payout_freq": "YEARLY",
    "product_code": "FD001"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "maturity_value": 50000.00,
  "maturity_date": "2030-10-10",
  "apy": 10.6508,           ‚úÖ Was 10.25, now correct!
  "effective_rate": 10.2500,
  "payout_freq": "YEARLY",
  "payout_amount": 5325.3792,
  "calc_id": 15,
  "result_id": 15
}
```

### Test 2: Monthly Compounding

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/fd-calculator/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "principal_amount": 100000,
    "tenure_value": 3,
    "tenure_unit": "YEARS",
    "interest_type": "COMPOUND",
    "compounding_frequency": "MONTHLY",
    "cumulative": false,
    "payout_freq": "QUARTERLY",
    "category1_id": "SENIOR",
    "product_code": "FD001"
  }'
```

**Expected APY:**
- Base rate: ~7.7% (from API)
- With SENIOR: 7.7% + 0.75% = 8.45%
- **APY with monthly compounding:** ~8.78%

## Understanding the Difference

### Effective Rate vs APY:

**Effective Rate (10.25%):**
- This is the **nominal annual rate**
- It's the sum of base rate + category benefits
- Does not account for compounding effect

**APY (10.6508%):**
- This is the **actual annual return**
- Accounts for the compounding effect
- Shows what you really earn per year

### Visual Explanation:

```
Effective Rate: 10.25%
Compounding: QUARTERLY

Quarter 1: 50,000 √ó 2.5625% = 51,281.25
Quarter 2: 51,281.25 √ó 2.5625% = 52,594.88
Quarter 3: 52,594.88 √ó 2.5625% = 53,942.26
Quarter 4: 53,942.26 √ó 2.5625% = 55,325.38

Actual gain: 55,325.38 - 50,000 = 5,325.38
Actual rate: (5,325.38 / 50,000) √ó 100 = 10.6508% ‚úì

This is the APY!
```

## Summary

### ‚úÖ What Was Fixed:

1. **APY Calculation:** Now properly accounts for compounding frequency
2. **Accurate Returns:** Shows true annual yield, not just nominal rate
3. **Transparency:** Customers see real earning potential

### üìä Impact:

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Effective Rate | 10.25% | 10.25% (unchanged) |
| APY (Quarterly) | 10.25% ‚ùå | 10.6508% ‚úÖ |
| Difference | 0% | +0.4008% |

### üéØ Key Points:

- ‚úÖ APY now reflects actual compounded return
- ‚úÖ Higher compounding frequency ‚Üí Higher APY
- ‚úÖ Simple interest ‚Üí APY = Effective Rate
- ‚úÖ Matches industry standard calculations
